## Brief Overview of the project

This project explores healthcare data management in Kenya, focusing on balancing patient privacy and efficient planning through data anonymization. It examines Kenya's healthcare infrastructure, analyzing patient load distribution and anonymization practices in public and private hospitals. Categorizing techniques by hospital levels, the project offers recommendations, considering computational resources. Insights from runtime analysis stress balancing privacy with feasibility. The proposed policy aims to standardize anonymization practices, benefiting healthcare globally.
